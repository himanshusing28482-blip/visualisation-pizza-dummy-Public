# Introduction:

# Pizza Sales Dataset

The Pizza Sales Dataset is a fictional dataset commonly used as an example in
data analytics and business intelligence courses, including IBM Cognos. The
dataset contains information about a pizza chain's sales over some time,
including details about the pizzas sold, the customers who purchased them, and
the stores where they were sold.

The dataset typically includes variables such as:
1. Date: the date of the sale,
2. Pizza ID: the ID of the pizza that was sold,
3. Pizza Name: the name of the pizza that was sold,
4. Pizza Size: the size of the pizza that was sold,
5. Pizza Price: the price of the pizza,
6. Quantity: the number of pizzas sold in the transaction, etc,

Using this dataset, analysts can gain insights into various aspects of the pizza
chain's business, such as which pizzas are most popular, which stores are
performing best, and which customers are making the most purchases. These
insights can then be used to make data-driven decisions that help improve the
company's bottom line
